This additional content helps you understand various details of the spec. </p> <p>The specification comes from Chapter&nbsp;8 of CSS&nbsp;2.2.</p> <h2> How do I use it? </h2> <p> The specification includes little speech bubbles (<img alt="[C]" class="inline-comment-bubble" src="/images/comment.svg">). Click or tap one to open a comment about the fragment which directly precedes the bubble. </p> <p> The comments are written in a way which allows you to read the spec from top to bottom, or jump right to a fragment that interests you. </p> <h2> Who is this website for? </h2> <p> The project is aimed at those who have some experience with CSS, and would like to get a more in‚Å†-‚Å†depth understanding of how the technology works. If you are a complete beginner in web development, the spec ‚Äì even with comments ‚Äì might be too challenging. </p> <h2> Why annotated specs? </h2> <p> Technical specifications aim to describe, with as little ambiguity as possible, all relevant details of a technology. The goal is to allow different developers to implement the technology with similar results. Specifications are often comprehensive and precise. </p> <p> They are not always easy reads, though. </p> <p> The idea behind adding explanations to selected fragments of a spec is to combine the precision of a technical specification with the approachability of a dedicated learning resource. </p> <h2>How can I contact you?</h2> <p> Thanks for asking!
