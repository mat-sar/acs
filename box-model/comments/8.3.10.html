However, with negative margin values, this analogy breaks to some degree: </p> <img src="/images/8.3.10-negative-margin-in-box-model.svg" alt="Representation of a CSS box, with the outlines of the content box,
      padding box, border box, and margin box marked. The margin box has a
      negative bottom margin, such that the bottom margin edge is higher than
      the bottom padding edge."> <p> Boxes are typically laid out such that the margin edge of one box “touches” the margin edge of another box. Thus, negative margins will often lead to the visual effect of boxes overlapping: </p> <img src="/images/8.3.10-negative-margin-in-inline-box.svg" alt="Two words, 'Some' and 'words', each in a box of its own. The first
      box has a negative right margin, with the effect that the box's content
      edge partly overlaps with the content edge of the second box. The result
      is that 'words' partly covers 'Some'."> <!-- <p>
      You can play with an example such as above using

    </p> --> <p> Note that in theory, the overlap effect might be absent in some browsers. The spec states that while negative margins values are valid, <q>there may be implementation-specific limits</q>. That is, a browser might not be able to render a box with a negative margin, and still conform to the CSS&nbsp;2 spec. In practice, major browsers have supported negative margins for a long time. Already in 2004, Eric A. Meyer wrote in <i>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide</i>: <q>As of this writing, there are few, if any, such limits in current browsers.</q> </p> <p> It was quite on purpose that for the example above, I chose horizontal margins. Vertical margins have the added effect that they can <a href="/box-model/comments/8.3.1.1">collapse</a>, which adds another level of complexity. </p> </div> <div class="copyright-notice"> <p> <img alt="Creative Commons License" src="/images/CC_BY-SA_small.svg"> This work by <span xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" property="cc:attributionName">Mateusz Sarnecki</span> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. </p> </div> </article> </main> <script src="/scripts/main.js"></script> <!-- GoatCounter, privacy-sensitive web analytics --> <script data-goatcounter="https://msar.goatcounter.com/count" async="" src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script> </body></html>
